# UUID File (Drupal 7)

This Drupal module exposes the UUIDs of files as resource locators.

A suitable use case might be for hiding internal file structures and names,
while still making the files accessible in public.

Another possible use case might be for providing a permanent and system-independent resource locator for files.

# End of development

This is the last state of my legacy code for Drupal 7.

A complete rewrite and reconception for Drupal 8 is being considered.

# Requirements
